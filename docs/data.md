# Data

`DataFeed` (`marketdata/datafeed.py`) reads daily OHLCV data from
`<instrument>.csv` under a data root directory, resolved in this order:

1. the `data_root` argument passed to `DataFeed(instrument, data_root=...)`,
2. the `SIMAGORA_DATA_ROOT` environment variable,
3. `data/csv/` under the current working directory, by default.

No sample data ships with this repository, so a data root must be populated
(or pointed at via `SIMAGORA_DATA_ROOT`) before the simulator can run. Each CSV is
expected to have the columns `date, open, high, low, close, volume, adj_close`
(see `csvhandler.py`).
